'''
logger_ng is an enhanced replacement for the original rapidsms logger

It should be included as the first app in your local.ini file. It performs
a number of functions:
    - Store a LoggedMessage object for every incoming and outgoing message.
    - Inject a logger_id watermark into the rapidsms Message object as
      it passes through.
    - Associate outgoing messages to their soliciting incoming message when
      Message.respond is used by an app.
    - Look-up a message's reporter and store it with the LoggedMessage
    - Store the message.status (CharField) along with the message.
    - Provide a convenient web interface to view the message log
    - Allow users to respond to messages from the web interface
    - Imports from the original logger app

logger_ng does not play well with logger. To switch from using the original
logger app, to logger_ng, simply edit your local.ini and change logger
in your apps list to logger_ng.
Then create the logger_ng table by running ./rapidsms syncdb
Import your old logs from logger by running ./rapidsms import_from_logger

Permissions:
    'logger_ng.can_view' - Required to view the logger_ng web interface
    'logger_ng.can_respond' - Required to send SMS response from the web

Conflicts:
    logger app

Dependencies:
    direct_sms and others
