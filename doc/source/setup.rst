Setup

#. Copy / paste the entire logger_ng folder to the ./apps directory of your 
project.
#. Add 'logger_ng' **at the begining** of the app list in your *.ini file.
#. If you already used 'logger' on this project, remove the 'logger' app 
(as they are not compatible)
from your *.ini file and run ``./rapidsms import_from_logger`` to update to
import the old logs 

.. note:: ``./rapidsms import_from_logger`` doesn't delete the old logs.
