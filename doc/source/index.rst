   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to logger_ng's documentation!
=====================================

Logger NG is a `RapidSMS <http://www.rapidsms.org/>`_ app that allows you
to send an SMS outside the router thread (e.g. from a Django view).

For now, it's tested only with the first version of RapidSMS, not the new core, 
and requires the `DirectSMS <http://github.com/ksamuel/Direct-SMS>`_ app to work.
